<h2>About the Ham Radio Logging App</h2>

<p>As a Ham Radio Operator, the FCC requires a log of some of your ham radio activity. Examples would be if a third party transmits on your frequency, you're working international stations, and/or if you're in a ham radio contest. Logs of activity become crucially important when there's complaints about radio interference, and the FCC can request a copy of your logs at any time for investigative purposes. </p>

<p>In terms of logging, there's three modes that ham radio operators can use - a pen and paper logbook, a computer program that can be downloaded, or using a web application. The problems are that there hasn't been a web service logging platform that's been developed that's modern looking and responsive, which means that it can be used on a mobile phone or tablet.</p>

<p>Hopefully this app will change that. My goal is to have a logging platform that is mobile friendly and responsive, those logs will be stored on a SQL server, and then can be recalled into a report, if needed. </p>
